# Welcome to Diver!

<br>

<p align='justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an AI-powered chatbot that helps you navigate my tech blog https://naomilago.com. It can answer questions about my blog posts, my technology skills, and my projects. It can also help you find relevant questions about my own technology skills, by explaining complex concepts in simple terms and also in a friendly manner.</p>

> The most important thing is that this project is part of the Imers√£o IA, a project created by [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) and [Google](https://google.com), a Brazilian online learning platform. The goal of this project is to help people learn how to get the most out of AI and explore Gemini's powerhouse.
